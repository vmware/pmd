## Overview
Photon Management Daemon (pmd) provides secure remote management of
resources on linux machines.

pmd manages the following resources
* iptable rules
* network via netmgmt component
* packages via tdnf
* users and groups

pmd provides the following ways to interact with the server
* cmd line client (pmd-cli) uses dce-rpc and srp to securely authenticate
* REST api (spec driven with openapi swagger 2.0)
* server openapi spec driven REST cmd line client (copenapi)
* python2/3 api

## Documentation
### pmd-cli
These are the current registered components
 'firewall' : firewall management
 'net' : network management
 'pkg' : package management
 'usr' : user management
You need to specify a component and a command
usage: pmd-cli [connection/auth options] <component> <command> [command options]

For local connections, use: pmd-cli <component> <cmd> <options>.
Current logged in user permissions will apply when executing commands.
This is the same as specifying --servername localhost.
For remote servers, use one of 3 methods mentioned below.
Password is never sent out in clear to the remote in any of the below auth scenarios.
When --user is specified, you will be prompted for password.
1. System user.
   pmd-cli --servername <server> --user <user>
2. Lightwave user (pmd server must be joined or should be part of embedded lightwave)
   pmd-cli --servername <server> --user <user> --domain <lightwave domain>
3. Kerberos spn (client must successfully run kinit before using this method)
   pmd-cli --servername <server> --spn <service principal name>

### REST interface
self documenting via conf/restapispec.json or copenapi client

### python
import pmd
help(pmd)
srv = pmd.server()
help(srv)
help(srv.net)
